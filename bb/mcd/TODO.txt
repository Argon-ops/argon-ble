#   handle it a little gracefully...at least issue a helpful warning

#  Or would it be clever to provide a nothing playable that just sends notifications...
#   a nothing playable that you just use as a delay notification. maybe we'd want to offer that
#    but let's not use it to paper over an empty playable

    # TODO: consider adding an audio only type playable

# FROM CUSTOM_PS_AS_Collection

# FIXME: new playables get an 'anim_name' key by default somehow. find out why...
#    Since it isn't happening in InitPlayable


    # TODO: fields for an object to own the audioSource (or bool option please use some audio mixer attached to camera)

# TODO: try zipping this module and loading it from prefs
# TODO: for the prefs. (I guess) define __package__ for this package?

# FIXME: items don't remove from list when materials are deleted

# TODO: BoxColliders should have enableables? (Yes, but too much; save it for the next ship)

            # TODO: let any click or trigger handler have destroy settings...
            #  so separate configs: the destroy settings 
            #    and the destroy when: never, after first interaction

# TODO: (probably already noted) the 3d view switches to edit mode without being asked to. when its loaded

# TODO: FIXME: references to commands stored in Click/Trigger Interaction handlers are not removed when 
   the command is deleted.


# TODO: NOT HERE: the Commands list in the UI may show a command that is never actually written to the object.
#   This happens when a command exists and they have just added an interaction handler like.
#   Unfortunately, we'll need to reorganize how commands work. Because it's not ok to make people think that
#    a command has been set (maybe the one that popped up was what they wanted and they didn't touch it)
#    but never have that command actually be written to the object. Best to not give this impression


# InteractionHandlerLike
# There's some difficulty with _playables: long story short, we don't know how to make the playable/command picker pop-up
#    happy in the case where there aren't any playables/commands. Blender will spam a warning to the console in this case.
#     It comes down to the trickiness of having an enum with no members.
#  To handle this properly, we would want to:
#    A: not show the pop-up when there are 0 playables (only show 'create playable')
#    B: handle the case where there are playables but the user hasn't picked one yet.
