#   handle it a little gracefully...at least issue a helpful warning

#  Or would it be clever to provide a nothing playable that just sends notifications...
#   a nothing playable that you just use as a delay notification. maybe we'd want to offer that
#    but let's not use it to paper over an empty playable

    # TODO: consider adding an audio only type playable

# FROM CUSTOM_PS_AS_Collection

# FIXME: new playables get an 'anim_name' key by default somehow. find out why...
#    Since it isn't happening in InitPlayable

# TODO: try zipping this module and loading it from prefs
# TODO: for the prefs. (I guess) define __package__ for this package?

# FIXME: items don't remove from list when materials are deleted

# TODO: BoxColliders should have enableables? (Yes, but too much; save it for the next ship)

            # TODO: let any click or trigger handler have destroy settings...
            #  so separate configs: the destroy settings 
            #    and the destroy when: never, after first interaction

# TODO: (probably already noted) the 3d view switches to edit mode without being asked to. when its loaded

# TODO: FIXME: references to commands stored in Click/Trigger Interaction handlers are not removed when 
   the command is deleted
