# Introduction
Argon is a plugin for Unity that lets you configure Unity game objects from within Blender.

Argon has two parts:

* a Blender addon that exports FBX files marked up with custom properties. 
* a Unity plugin that imports those files and applies those properties as Unity components.

The import script sets up connections between components as needed.

# Minimum Requirements

* Blender 3.2.1
* Unity 2022.3.61f1

# Installation

* Download the Unity importer. Hosted in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/Argon-ops/argon-slim)
* 


* 
* Install the package using the Unity Package Manager
* Open Blender and open a Preferences view
* Go to Add-ons
* Click the ‘Install…’ button
* Find and install Argon_Plugin_Source.zip under Resources/Blender
* The Argon plugin activation box should come into view (possibly after several seconds)
* Click the check box to activate it
* You should see a new tab on the right side of your 3D views in Blender that is titled ‘Argon’ (Press ‘n’ if you don’t see any right side tabs)
