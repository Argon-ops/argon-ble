# Introduction
Argon is a plugin for Unity that lets you configure Unity game objects from within Blender.

Argon has two parts:

* a Blender addon that exports FBX files marked up with custom properties. 
* a Unity plugin that imports those files and applies those properties as Unity components.

The import script sets up connections between components as needed.

# Minimum Requirements

* Blender 3.2.1
* Unity 2022.3.61f1

# Installation
See documenation in [the Unity plugin's repository](https://github.com/Argon-ops/argon-ble).
